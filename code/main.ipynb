      "Jordan discusses Cain's internal struggle and the consequences of his actions. He explains that God tells Cain that his problems are of his own making and that he has invited resentment into his life, which has led to his miserable state. Instead of making the necessary changes, Cain chooses to kill Abel out of jealousy. Jordan emphasizes that Cain's descendants become the first to create weapons of war, illustrating a broader theme of human conflict and the potential for resentment to lead to destructive behavior. He also reflects on the difficulty of identifying who among us might embody the characteristics of Cain.\n"
