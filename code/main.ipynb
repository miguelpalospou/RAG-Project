Despite being told by God that his problems stem from his own actions and that he needs to look to himself, Cain's resentment leads him to kill Abel. This act of fratricide is portrayed as part of a larger narrative about human conflict, jealousy, and the consequences of allowing negative emotions to take over. Cain's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of resentment and the choices individuals make in response to their feelings of inadequacy and jealousy.\n"
